# Check-Tac-Toe
Not tic-tac-toe, not checkers. Something in between but better than both. I couldn't think of a better name. My first python (and programming) project. A game like tic-tac-toe but not quite. A game like checkers but not quite. The winning configurations are exactly like tic-tac-toe's and moves are almost almost like checkers. 
The difference with tic-tac-toe is that each player in this game is limited to 3 pieces. The first 6 moves are exactly like tic-tac-toe's. Once all the pieces are placed on the board in the 6 moves, the next piece movements are by sliding, just like checkers, except no jumping over or capturing pieces. A piece can move to an adjacent empty neighbouring position: horizontal, vertical or diagonal. Slide along the lines indicated on the board. (The board is ugly. My first attempt at using Blender, which I swear to never touch again).  Slide as long as possible until one of the two players wins. There's only a limited number of configurations possible on the board so the game definitely has a magic sequence of steps to follow to always win. I haven't sat down to figure it out but I know it's possible. Homework for you

Check(ers Tic ) Tac Toe. The name makes no sense, but it just looks beautiful as a class name.
